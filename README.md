Learning pixel art game dev

This is built using react, in order to properly run it make sure you have node and npm installed on your computer (npm comes with node)

Make sure you add them to your system path. 

Then in your terminal navigate to the react-pixi directory and run "npm install" (without the quotes)

once it succesfully installs all of the dependencies then run "npm start" and it should start a live server
