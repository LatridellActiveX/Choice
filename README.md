Learning pixel art game dev

We need to set up a folder structure for the project. First things first a folder for the tmx files for the maps.

Determine what platform it will run on. I personally like the idea of express.js however it can be whatever works

I would imagine it would need to run on node.js

Mostly just basic setup to have it run on localhost so that the application can be tested.
