So this is where I plan on putting our ideas for the design of the game as a written description. 

We very well can use a third party website or app for notes on the design. I use oneNote, google Docs, etc. 


maps is where we will store the tmx and svg files for the map(s), we create. The question then becomes what do we use to render the map. 
If I can get three.js to render the map I think it would prove to be a very useful platform for the game as it supports things like collision detection and raycasting. As well as lighting, shaders, etc. 

I'll be awaiting approval to set this project up as a node.js project with express.js as the backend, however I would have to manually add all the filepaths statically with those frameworks which I do not mind doing. 
Any other ideas are more than welcome. 

Possibility for the game engine would be pixiejs instead of three.js
