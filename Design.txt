So this is where I plan on putting our ideas for the design of the game as a written description. 

We very well can use a third party website or app for notes on the design. I use oneNote, google Docs, etc. 

We are currently planning on using the map editor on https://www.mapeditor.org/

We are utilizing pixi.js for building this game engine. 

To be honest we haven't made any real progress on the game engine, we need to start incorporating pixi.js into the project as soon as we can.
